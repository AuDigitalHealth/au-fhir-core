#### Usage scenarios

The following are supported usage scenarios for this profile:

- Query for observations of oxygen saturation associated with a patient
- Record or update an observation of oxygen saturation associated with a patient


#### Relationship with national and international specifications

A resource conforming to this profile is conformant to:
- [observation-heartrate](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-heartrate.html)
  - and therefore conformant to IPS
- [IPA-Observation](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa/StructureDefinition-ipa-observation.html)

No equivalent US Core profile.

Conformance in reverse is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource conforming to (International Patient Access)[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa], (International Patient Summary)[http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips], or (US Core)[http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core] **MAY NOT** conform to AU Core.
