#### Usage scenarios

The following are supported usage scenarios for this profile:

- Query for basic information for an organisation by name or identifier
- Recording or updating basic information for an organisation 
- Read information about an organisation referenced by another resource


#### Relationship with national and international specifications

A resource conforming to this profile is conformant to:
- [Organization (IPS)](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition/Organization-uv-ips)
- and **MAY** be conformant to [US Core Organization](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization) noting that AU Core does not enforce the US Core constraint mandating Organization.active

Conformance in reverse is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource conforming to (International Patient Access)[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa], (International Patient Summary)[http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips], or (US Core)[http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core] **MAY NOT** conform to AU Core.

No equivalent IPA Organization profile.
