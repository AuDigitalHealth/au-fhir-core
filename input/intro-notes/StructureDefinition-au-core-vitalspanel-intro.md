#### Relationship with national and international specifications

A resource conforming to this profile is conformant to:
- [observation-vitalspanel](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-vitalspanel.html)
  - and therefore conformant to IPS
- [IPA-Observation](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa/StructureDefinition-ipa-observation.html)

No equivalent US Core profile.

Conformance in reverse is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource conforming to [International Patient Access](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa), [International Patient Summary](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips), or [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core) **MAY NOT** conform to AU Core.
