#### Usage scenarios

The following are supported usage scenarios for this profile:

- Query for a specific procedure or test request such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) order or a referral to a support program.
- Query for a specific service offered to a patient such as a referral to a support program.
- Query for category of service request (e.g. all cardiology requests)
- Record or update a request for a service for a patient


#### Comparison with other national and international specifications

A resource conforming to this profile is conformant to:
- [US Core ServiceRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-servicerequest)

No equivalent International Patient Access or International Patient Summary profile.

Conformance in reverse is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource conforming to [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core) **MAY NOT** conform to AU Core.


#### Profile specific implementation guidance
- `ServiceRequest.category` provides an efficient way of supporting system interactions, e.g. restricting searches. Implementers need to understand that data categorisation is somewhat subjective. The categorisation applied by the source may not align with a receiverâ€™s expectations.
- The ServiceRequest resource can represent a reason as a code with `ServiceRequest.reasonCode`, or a reference with `ServiceRequest.reasonReference` to a Condition or other resource.
  - Although both are marked as must support, sending systems are not required to support both a code and a reference, but they **SHALL** support *at least one* of these elements
  - A receiving or persisting system **SHALL** support both elements
- The ServiceRequest resource can represent the desired performer as a code with `ServiceRequest.performerType`, or a reference with `ServiceRequest.performer` to a HealthcareService or other resource.
  - Although both are marked as must support, sending systems are not required to support both a code and a reference, but they **SHALL** support *at least one* of these elements
  - A receiving or persisting system **SHALL** support both elements
- `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo` is broad to accommodate a wide variety of use cases by allowing a reference to any resource. 
   - Sending systems **SHALL** ensure references to external resources are only to resources that conform to at least an AU Core profile and the resource type is supported by the Conformance/Capability statement for that endpoint and conform
