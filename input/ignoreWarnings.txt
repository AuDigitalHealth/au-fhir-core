# === HL7 core warnings ===
The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# === This warning is based on FHIR IG Publisher best practice recommending that all observations include a performer. However, AU Core does not require Observation.performer as the Must Support flag was intentionally removed by the AU Core TDG agreement. AU Core examples align with this decision, and the warning can safely be ignored. ===
WARNING: Observation/bodyheight-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/bodytemp-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

WARNING: Observation/lipid-total-chol-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/observation-masked: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# === These warnings are expected due to the datatype choices in AU Base, which allows multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g. Address, Identifier). The warnings are trigerred because the IG Publisher matches instances against both the base FHIR types (e.g. Address) and the AU Base profiles (e.g. AU Address). This is intentional and does not indicate an issue with the implementation guide. ===

# === These warnings are trigerred because the PBS terminology (CodeSystem http://pbs.gov.au/code/item and related ValueSet) is not currently published in FHIR format and therefore cannot be validated by the IG Publisher. The PBS CodeSystem and ValueSet are placeholders with valid URLs but do not include actual code definitions in the terminology server. This is an expected limitation. These codes have been checked offline and these warnings can be safely ignored. ===

# === This example uses the Data Absent Reason extension to represent missing data for the requester field, in line with AU Core rules for handling missing data. The warning is triggered due to this representation. The example is intentionally designed to demonstrate the representation of missing data and does not indicate an issue with the implementation guide. ==
WARNING: MedicationRequest/paracetamol-codeine: MedicationRequest.requester: A Reference without an actual reference or identifier should have a display

# === These informational messages are triggered the IG Publisher tooling, which infers the default language "en-AU" from the jurisdiction. The terminology server (tx.ontoserver) used for validation does not support "en-AU" for SNOMED CT lookup and instead expects "en". This is a known limitation of the tooling and terminology server. These codes were checked manually and these messages can be safely ignored.

# === AU Core uses the discriminator type 'pattern', which is valid for R4 but deprecated in R5+. Future updates will consider transitioning to the recommended 'type=value' approach to ensure compatibility with R5+. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
