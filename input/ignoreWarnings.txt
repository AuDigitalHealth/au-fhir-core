# =========================================================================================

# ===  These HTML fragments provide a summary information about this guide that is either not relevant (e.g. AU Core does not define any global profiles) or is already addressed through other means in the guide. Suppressing these warnings does not impact the IG's conformance or usability. ===
The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# === This warning is based on FHIR IG Publisher best practice, which recommends that all observations include a performer. AU Core does not require Observation.performer as the Must Support flag was removed based on the TDG agreement. AU Core examples align with this decision, and the warning can be safely ignored. ===
WARNING: Observation/bodyheight-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/bodytemp-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/bodyweight-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/lipid-hdl-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/lipid-ldl-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/lipid-triglyceride-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/pulserate-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/resprate-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/smokingstatus-current-smoker: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/bloodpressure-data-absent: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/lipid-total-chol-1: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/observation-masked: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# === These warnings are expected and are trigerred because AU Base allows multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier) that are also used in AU Core. The IG Publisher matches instances against both the core FHIR types (e.g. Address) and the AU Base profiles (e.g. AU Address). This behaviour is intentional and aligns with the design of AU Core and AU Base. ===

# === These warnings are trigerred because the PBS terminology (CodeSystem http://pbs.gov.au/code/item and related ValueSet) is not currently published in FHIR format and therefore cannot be validated by the IG Publisher. The PBS CodeSystem and ValueSet use valid URLs as placeholders but do not include actual code definitions in the terminology server. This is an expected limitation, and the codes have been verified offline. These warnings can be safely ignored as they do not indicate any issue with the implementation guide. ===

# === This example uses the Data Absent Reason extension to represent missing data for the requester element, following AU Core rules for handling missing data. The warning is triggered due to this representation. The example is intentionally designed to demonstrate the handling of missing data and does not indicate an issue with the implementation guide. ==

# === Information about the usage of additional codes or identifiers not defined in AU Core profiles is provided to highlight their inclusion. These informational messages are expected and do not indicate any issues with the implementation guide.  ===

# === Informational messages that results from inherited slicing in the base profile. The AU Core profile does not redeclare the slicing discriminator but remains valid. These messages are expected and do not indicate any issues with the implementation guide. ===

# === These informational messages are generated by the IG Publisher tooling, which infers the default language "en-AU" from the jurisdiction. The terminology server (tx.ontoserver) used for validation does not recognise "en-AU" for SNOMED CT lookup and instead expects "en". This is a known limitation of the tooling and terminology server. These codes were manually verified.

# === Information about the AU Core use of the discriminator type 'pattern,' which is fully valid and supported in FHIR R4 but deprecated in R5+. This does not affect the functionality or conformance in R4. Future updates will consider transitioning to the recommended 'type=value' approach to ensure compatibility with R5+. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
