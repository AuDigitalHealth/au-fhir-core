# === WARNING: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier) from AU Base. The IG Publisher cannot match instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Core and AU Base. ===

# === WARNING: Examples with PBS concepts have this warning as there is no publicly available instance of the PBS code system and therefore IG Publisher cannot validate the concept. This is known, accepted behaviour for IG Publisher. ===
WARNING: Medication/2active-ingredients: Medication.code: Unable to check whether the code is in the value set '' because the code system http://pbs.gov.au/code/item was not found
WARNING: Medication/2active-ingredients: Medication.code.coding[0].system: A definition for CodeSystem 'http://pbs.gov.au/code/item' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
WARNING: Medication/2active-ingredients: Medication.code: Unable to check whether the code is in the value set 'http://terminology.hl7.org.au/ValueSet/pbs-item|5.0.0' because the code system http://pbs.gov.au/code/item was not found
WARNING: Medication/2active-ingredients: Medication.code: A definition for CodeSystem 'http://pbs.gov.au/code/item' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated; Unable to check whether the code is in the value set '' because the code system http://pbs.gov.au/code/item was not found; Unable to check whether the code is in the value set 'http://terminology.hl7.org.au/ValueSet/pbs-item|5.0.0' because the code system http://pbs.gov.au/code/item was not found
WARNING: Medication/2active-ingredients: Medication.code.coding[0]: Resolved system http://pbs.gov.au/code/item (v5.0.0), but the definition doesn't include any codes, so the code has not been validated

# === WARNING: This example demonstrates how to repesent missing data and therefore uses the Data Absent Reason extension as per AU Core rules. The IG Publisher triggers a warning because of this, but the example is intentionally designed to show the correct handling of missing data and does not indicate any issues with the IG. ===
WARNING: MedicationRequest/paracetamol-codeine: MedicationRequest.requester: A Reference without an actual reference or identifier should have a display

# === Information ====
# =========================================================================================

# === Information about the usage of additional codes or identifiers not defined in AU Core profiles is provided to highlight their inclusion. These informational messages are expected and do not indicate any issues with the implementation guide.  === 
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/au-core-medication|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/au-core-patient|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/au-core-heartrate|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/au-core-practitionerrole|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# === Informational messages that results from inherited slicing in the base profile. The AU Core profile does not redeclare the slicing discriminator but remains valid. These messages are expected and do not indicate any issues with the implementation guide. === 
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp|4.0.1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# === Information about the use of standard CapabilityStatementExpectation extension in additional contexts to fully express intended capabilities; see FHIR-12419. ===
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/capabilitystatement-search-parameter-combination|5.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# === These informational messages are generated by the IG Publisher tooling, which infers the default language "en-AU" from the jurisdiction. The terminology server (tx.ontoserver) used for validation does not recognise "en-AU" for SNOMED CT lookup and instead expects "en". This is a known limitation of the tooling and terminology server. These codes were manually verified. See related Zulip chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/437028-Terminology-Service-Test-Cases/topic/DisplayLanguage.20with.20Accept.20Header.20like.20Syntax. ===

# === Information about the AU Core use of the discriminator type 'pattern,' which is fully valid and supported in FHIR R4 but deprecated in R5+. This does not affect the functionality or conformance in R4. Future updates will consider transitioning to the recommended 'type=value' approach to ensure compatibility with R5+. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
