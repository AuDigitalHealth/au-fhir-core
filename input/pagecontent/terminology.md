This page lists all ValueSets and CodeSystems defined as part of this specification. 

As well as these included definitions this specification typically references [AU Base](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/terminology.html) and [National Clinical Terminology Service (NCTS)](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir) terminology resources. 

### Value Sets

See the [FHIR terminology section]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on value sets and a list of value set names used in FHIR.  Most value sets used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification or [AU Base](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/terminology.html). The following value sets are unique to this guide.

## Code systems

See the [FHIR terminology section]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on code systems and a list of code system names used in FHIR.  All code systems used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification or [AU Base](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/terminology.html). No code systems have been defined for this implementation guide.
