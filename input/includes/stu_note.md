#### Preview of AU Core 1.0.0 for testing

This December 2024 preview snapshot incorporates the normative changes from AU Core 1.0.0-ballot. This snapshot supports testing of AU Core 1.0.0 prior to publication.

Testing AU Core helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU Core and provide essential feedback.

To learn more about testing AU Core or express your interest in participating, see [AU Core FHIR IG Testing](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AU+Core+FHIR+IG+Testing).

Key changes between this version and the ballot version are available on the [Change Log](changes.html).
