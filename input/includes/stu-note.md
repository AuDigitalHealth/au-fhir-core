#### AU Core R1 Scope Update Note
AU Core FHIR implementation guide has undergone the content pruning to exclusively include resources definitely identified in scope for Release 1 (R1) and those under consideration. 
To provide a historical context, a permanent reference branch <a href="https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-core/tree/0.2.3-archive">0.2.3-archive</a> is has been established. Given the anticipated rapid changes in content influenced by ongoing scope discussions guided primarily by AUCDI mappings and the Technical Design Group (TDG) requirements, this approach ensures transparency and facilitates iterative evolution.

##### Feedback on AUCDI mappings
AUCDI mappings to AU Core are one of the key scope drivers for R1. In our commitment to refining AU Core, we are seeking feedback on proposed mappings on Confluence page <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AUCDI+in+AU+Core+R1">AUCDI in AU Core R1</a>. The TDGs insights are instrumental in ensuring that mappings are align accurately with Australian context. The members can contribute by adding comments in Confluence, or via Zulip chat <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-astralia/topic/Implementing.20AUCDI.20R1.20into.20AU.20Core.20R1">Implementing AUCDI R1 into AU Core R1</a>.
  

##### Feedback on scope discussions
We invite TDG members to actively engage in providing feedback and insights into the defined scope. Community feedback and contribution are crucial in refining the scope and ensuring that the IG meets the 'real-world' needs. Please review <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AU+Core+R1+Scope">AU Core R1 Scope</a> proposal and comment in Confluence, or via Zulip <a href="chat https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia</a>.
