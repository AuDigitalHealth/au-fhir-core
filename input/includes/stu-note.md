#### AU Core R1 Scope Update Note
AU Core FHIR implementation guide has undergone the content pruning to exclusively include resources definitely identified in scope for Release 1 (R1) and those under consideration. 
A permanent reference branch <a href="https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-core/tree/0.2.3-archive">0.2.3-archive</a> is made available to maintain a permanent record of all historical content. It is expected that some content from the permanent reference branch may be brought across to AU Core in the future. 

#### AU Core Scope drivers
<ul>
<li>Australian Core Data set for Interoperability (AUCDI)</li>
<li>AU Core Technical Design Group (TDG) scoping: <a href="https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-core/discussions/categories/au-core-r1-resource-priority-list?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22AU+Core+R1+Resource+Priority+List%22+sort%3Atop+created%3A%3E%3D2022-11-17&page=1">Resources of Priority for AU Core R1</a></li>
<li>Use cases of interest to the community</li>
<li>National and international specifications: US Core, International Patient Summary, International Patient Access</li>
</ul>

#### AUCDI in AU Core
AUCDI mappings to AU Core are one of the key scope drivers for R1. We are seeking feedback on proposed mappings on Confluence page <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AUCDI+in+AU+Core+R1">AUCDI in AU Core R1</a>. The Technical Design Group (TDG) members can contribute by adding comments in Confluence, or via Zulip chat <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia/topic/Implementing.20AUCDI.20R1.20into.20AU.20Core.20R1">Implementing AUCDI R1 into AU Core R1</a>.

#### Ongoing AU Core R1 Scope discussions
AU Core R1 Scope is currently under active discussion and refinement.  As a result of these discussions, the content of this IG is expected to change rapidly. 
Community feedback and contribution is crucial in shaping the scope to meet the 'real-world' needs. Members of the TDG are encouraged to contribute to these discussions. You can contribute in a number of ways: 
<ul>
<li>Review <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AU+Core+R1+Scope">AU Core R1 Scope</a> proposal and comment in Confluence.</li>
<li>Attend AU Core TDG meetings - next meeting held on <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=208472513">2024-01-11</a> will include the scope proposal update</li> 
</ul>
